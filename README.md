Usage

    Theme toggle button must have the ID theme-toggle.

    Mobile menu toggle button must have the ID menu-toggle, and the nav menu must have the ID nav-menu.

    Header element should have the class .header.

Project Structure

/ (root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.php          # Main PHP file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css         # CSS styling including themes and layout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js          # Main JavaScript file (contains all classes and logic)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon/           # Images, icons, and other static assets

Customization

    Themes: Modify CSS variables in your stylesheet under [data-theme="dark"] and [data-theme="light"].

    Server IP: Change the server IP text content inside the element with id="server-ip".

    Embed Videos: Call loadYouTube() or loadTwitch() to lazy-load embedded content in designated containers.

Accessibility

    Keyboard navigation is supported for interactive elements.

    aria-expanded and other ARIA attributes can be added to menu toggles for enhanced screen reader support.

    Feedback messages for copy operations use polite, visually distinct notifications.

Performance

    Scroll events are throttled/debounced and use requestAnimationFrame to minimize layout thrashing.

    Page Visibility API pauses animations when the tab is inactive to save CPU.

    Performance marks and measurements can be logged in the console for development insights.
